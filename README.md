# Mushroom Classification Using Machine Learning
The UCI Machine Learning Repository provided the Mushroom dataset, which was employed in this investigation. The Audubon Society Field Guide donated this dataset on April 26, 1987, and it provides descriptions of the many physical attributes of mushrooms. This dataset's main goal is to categorise mushrooms as edible or poisonous according to their characteristics. The dataset is widely utilised in machine learning and data science applications for classification tasks, and it is especially important for comprehending the edible nature of mushrooms. The dataset is an invaluable tool for investigating pattern recognition algorithms and developing predictive models to differentiate between edible and poisonous mushrooms due to its extensive collection of mushroom properties and their accompanying classifications.
